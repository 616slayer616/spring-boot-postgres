# spring-boot-postgres

This repositiory is a basic setup to creat a RESTful API with spring.
It uses a PostgreSQL for deployment database and an H2 in-memory database for testing. This is configured with Springs's profiles.
The tests include repository tests for testing custom SQL queries and MockMvc tests for the REST controllers, including a setup for Test driven documentation.
